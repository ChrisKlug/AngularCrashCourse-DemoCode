# Angular Crash Course
This repo contains the code used for my Angular Crash Course that I present at conferences. It is no way a best practices project, but a good introduction to a lot of things Angular.

## Get started
To get started, clone the repo and run npm install
```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisKlug/AngularCrashCourse-DemoCode.git
cd AngularCrashCourse-DemoCode
npm restore
```

## Run the application
To run the application, just use the Angular-CLI
```
ng serve
```
and browse to http://localhost:4200/

## Pre requisites
The project assumes that you have Node installed on your machine, as well as the Angular-CLI.

If not, Node is available at [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)

The Angular-CLI is installed using
```
npm install @angular/cli
```
